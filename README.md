built with SQL(sequelize/sqlite3).

A CRUD application that handles creating, storing, updating and deleting users via sign-up and course entries.

General Info
The aim for this showcase Full-Stack CRUD application is to let potential clients and employers see what I have done so far and the stack I have been using on each of the projects. 
Expect this app to grow as my journey towards a Full-Stack developer continues - The next step is to built the Front-End side of this project.

The app is started by downloading all the files and by running the ```npm install``` and then ```npm start``` ON BOTH    ```../api``` and ```../client``` folders. Routes can be 
tested via PostmanCanary. Import the test schema provided for convenience.

Once installed, use the ```npx run seed``` command in the terminal from the ```../api``` folder to initialize the database.
